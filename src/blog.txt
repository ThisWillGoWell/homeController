Concept
Server-modulas

since I want this project to be able to control/monitor my entrire house, I wanted there to be a central server that
all other "modules" would make HHTP requests. In this case we are running the server on the same pi so all requets of
the module makes are though local host.

THis means that the server has no direct connection to the outside world. It can talk only though the network
Also, It does not know what modules are in the system, the moduels just know what calls to make to effect their system.

SO basically to add a new modual to the system

Calls go: /set?system=HVAV_0&what=roomTemp%to=78
The system woukd know whould have a link to the HVAC0 system to the hvac0 object.

then there is either getSystemState
or /get?system=HVAC_0&what=roomTemp

Other objects easly added:
Lights
Garage Door
