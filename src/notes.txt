Whats the deal?
    1) Menu on the LCD Sreen
    2) Brennans App
    3) SQL <-!!!! (though not required with this logging...)
    4) Hue Light intergration
    5) Controller in my room...
        benefit of controlling them though server (vs stand alone app)?
        Can put switches in my room!
        maybe rewire light boox lol, and
        Brennans code!
